# PLP-Parallel-Programming
A repository that contains assignments for my Parallel Programming (PLP) course in university.
Those assignments were submitted for semester 2019-2.
There are 2 assignments:

1. Threads synchronization
2. Count the number of occurrences of a specific character in a file using Message Passing Interface (MPI)
  
The assignments text and reports are also included alongside the used MPI.net version.
The first assignment was tested on .Net Core v3.1.300, and the second one runs fine on .Net framework v4.0
